- ⚡ Fun fact: I am pursuing a career in the IT industry while learning everyday and adding more knowledge to things I have learnt. I have always been interested in data as it is part of our everyday life and as a mean of understanding what is happening around us through analysis. Throughout my journey towards IT, Python had always been a very difficult part of my learning as I am a self-taught student and this is why I have always worked hard to learn more, so please, feel free to reach out for collaborations as I am willing to keep learning and I would appreciate your efforts. I am also open to Internships and on the job training to help me more as I believe a proper mentorship is what I require at this stage of my learning. Thanks
